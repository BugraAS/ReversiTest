        - render handling based on loaded gui elements//
        - Click event handling based on screen state//
    - Rudimentary network server and client://
        - Incredibly rushed systems with no security whatsoever//
        - Is held together with ductapes and prayers//
Thing I couldn't finish://
    - The Actual game://
        - I roughly finished everything neccesary on the network side to handle a game//
        - but ran out of time before i actually implemented the game//
    - Server://
        - I thought I was done but the server gives me a "FYOU" response even if it gets correct messages and all.//
